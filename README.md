Nanocore RAT — main capabilities

Remote device access — allows an attacker to take remote control of an infected machine and run arbitrary commands.

Screen capture / recording — can capture screenshots or record the desktop to monitor user activity.

Keylogger — records keystrokes to collect passwords, messages and other typed data.

Webcam & microphone spying — can activate a device’s webcam and microphone to eavesdrop or record video.

Execute programs & commands — runs programs, scripts or system commands on the compromised host.

File system access — browse, download, upload, modify or delete files on the victim’s disk.

Message/data interception — can capture data from messaging apps or other applications.

Evasion techniques — uses obfuscation, packing or encryption to try to avoid detection by antivirus/endpoint products.

Connect to remote servers — contacts command-and-control servers to receive instructions or download payloads.

Process management — start, stop or manipulate running processes and services.

Establish persistence — install components (e.g., trojanized modules or registry/startup entries) to survive reboots.

Multiple connection methods — supports different ports/protocols (TCP/UDP, etc.) and fallback channels to maintain connectivity.

Note: this is a high-level, informational description. Using or distributing RATs without explicit legal authorization is illegal and unethical — only study or test such tools in controlled, consented environments (e.g., a lab or with written permission).
